# RackRental.net Operating Company LLC

A bit of explanation is required for this one.

For clarity this is NOT for the RackRental.net (series) LLC (aka TSYS HQ RackRental Franchise).

This is for the RackRental.net Operating Company LLC, which is the franchisor of RackRental/Starting Line Productions:

    - the brand
    - control plane
    - supporting microservices
    
to those who wish to rent out their own lab equipment/space/time.

- Please see the : [RackRental Plan](https://plan.rackrental.net).

This is the business/product/operations plan/operating agreement/franchise agreement for development of the RackRental/STL franchisor business and also includes a franchisee business plan (the one used by RackRental.net (series) LLC/Starting Line Productions (series) LLC.).

It's much different that the other plans, as this is entirely a sales driven "virtual" business with (close to if not entirely) zero product development work needed on the part of {{PARTY2}}.

- $40.00 goes to RackRental.net Operating Company LLC (as the franchisor) (as they get 40% of revenue)
- $4.00 (of the $40.00) goes to {{PARTY1}}
- $36.00 (of the $40.00) goes to {{PARTY2}}

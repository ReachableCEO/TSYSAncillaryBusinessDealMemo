## RWSCP Executive Summary

RWSCP is a ground up re-take on the venture capital model. It invests deeply in :

	- hard/deep tech (b2b, b2c, b2g) (partnering deeply with STL)
	- Gov tech (b2g) Usually in the hard/deep tech space but not exclusively) (partnering deeply with MerchantsOfHope)
	
	- It is aggresively targeting the following distribution of outcomes:
		- 90% full success rate of 20x or more return 
		- 5% partial success rate of 5-10x or more return 
		- 5% rate of merger/aquisition/acquohire etc (soft landings) (sometimes the product or service is fantastic but the execution is problematic or culture has rotted)

		We do this through:
		- having a stadardized pitch package available online and licensed under AGPLv3 (in hopes other firms adopt our value creating/capital growth ways) 
		- an extremely proprietary, quantative and qualatative data driven pitch scoring and evaluation system.

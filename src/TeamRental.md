## TeamRental.net Business, Operations, Product Plan


- Business description/idea/model: A SAAS play. An implementation of the overall TSYS backend stack as turn key server / software stack:
  - VPS (netcup)
  - cloudron,coolify (pre configured to connect to cloudron), cosmos
  - Backblaze backups.

- Costs/sale price/margins etc:
  - Cost would be 66.00 (presuming 1tb of backup).
  - MSRP of 120.00 per month.

The stack is pretty well developed/deployed/tested. Product/market fit has been found.

- Level of development effort:

Should be very straightforward to build out using the KNEL micro services.

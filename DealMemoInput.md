### Sol-Calc.com

#### Sol-Calc.com Pitch

- Sol-Calc.com Executive Summary

  - For sol-calc, the core micro service is GPLv3. You would have complete control over the branding / pricing etc of the SAAS front end (which is how most people would use it. So few would self host and they wouldn’t have paid anyway). This allows for the community to provide feedback on the algorithm. Could someone take it and launch a competing service ? Sure. Will they? Doubtful. Branding is a thing.

  - sol-calc.com (solar calculator I’ve been building as I am doing a custom design / ground mount of 5kw of panels. Very early microservice development underway.

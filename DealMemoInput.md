- YourDreamNameHere.com Executive Summary

YourDreamNameHere (a business in a box to automate domain/social and back office provisioning) (would cross / up sell TeamRental.net as one of the vendor choices). Otherwise monthly affiliate revenue from SAAS vendors (quickbooks, office or gmail, etc) and a setup fee (I recommend two months of SAAS affiliate revenue as the setup fee).

Should be very straightforward to build out using the KNEL micro services and a low code / no code platform (we have a few available and can spin them up if desired),

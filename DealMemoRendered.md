### Sol-Calc.com

#### Sol-Calc.com Pitch

- Sol-Calc.com Executive Summary

  - For sol-calc, the core micro service is GPLv3. You would have complete control over the branding / pricing etc of the SAAS front end (which is how most people would use it. So few would self host and they wouldn’t have paid anyway). This allows for the community to provide feedback on the algorithm. Could someone take it and launch a competing service ? Sure. Will they? Doubtful. Branding is a thing.

  - sol-calc.com (solar calculator I’ve been building as I am doing a custom design / ground mount of 5kw of panels. Very early microservice development underway.

YourDreamNameHere (a business in a box to automate domain/social and back office provisioning) (would cross / up sell TeamRental.net as one of the vendor choices). Otherwise monthly affiliate revenue from SAAS vendors (quickbooks, office or gmail, etc) and a setup fee (I recommend two months of SAAS affiliate revenue as the setup fee). It’s nothing more than a domain and an idea.

## Responsibilities and context for Wyble Family Office LLC

- Wyble Family Office LLC retains all infrastructure control (DNS/hosting etc)
- Known Element Enterprises LLC (KNEL) (the TSYS group management company) (see <https://community.turnsys.com/t/tsys-group-taxonomy/64> for an overview of TSYS group) will provide core IT/business infrastructure on the same footing as it provides to other TSYS group businesses. Including marketing website,business intelligence, ERP, marketing, web analytics, backups , monitoring, mailing lists, accounting and other back office functions. This support does NOT include compute / storage / network for customer workloads or data, except for RackRental (at Richelle) and STL (and any franchisees of STL). Franchisees of RackRental and STL  must provide compute / storage / network / rentable assets  (which would be inherent in the fact that they have capacity in r assets to rent and would have built all that out), but must use the core KNEL IT/business systems as a control plane (for rentals). Also sol-calc compute /storage / network will be provided by KNEL.
- RackRental.net Operating Company LLC will complete the development of RackRental middleware / backend (micro services). The code will remain proprietary to RackRental. It will be exposed as micro services.
- ProForma Party 2 and Known Element Enteprises LLC will jointly complete the development of signup, payment, provisioning micro services for . The code will be developed as micro services and made available for use by the other businesses.

## Responsibilities and context for ProForma Party 2

- ProForma Party 2 retains all financial control (bank accounts/third party payment processors)

- ProForma Party 2 will have total control over ThePeerNet/TeamRental/YourDreamNameHere/MerchantsOfHope. They can be closed/opensource, whatever you want.

- you want to be a leader, be in the driver seat, put your brand/stamp on everything

- you have a deep network of personnel/talent , a deep contact network etc

- Wyble Family Office LLC has no real interest in these “ancillary businesses” but would like to retain a minority silent stake.

- The only thing I ask, is that TSYS Group/Redwood Group and the Non Profits get use of the stack forever at 0 charge (we would pay any actual costs like domain registration of course). (I have an on-premise computer room that will handle all of the heavy compute/storage for all of those companies, so we wouldn’t eat into your margins).

- RackRental is pretty core to suborbital, so I would retain development control over it. It’s closed source and would remain so. It has some hefty middleware and backend bits (three racks of gear). Also I have GPU cluster and that needs to remain ITAR controlled. I just don’t want to deal with marketing/sales/go-to-market.

- StartingLineProductions is pretty integral to Suborbital in terms of us using it to manage our R&D overhead. Open to discuss specifics of how that would work. Maybe some kind of multi tenant setup and we have full control of our tenant?
